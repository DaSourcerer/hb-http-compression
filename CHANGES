1.0-beta2
 o Got rid of the compress transfer encoding. It's seeing little support anyway.
 o Added threshold option
 o Added optional new line removal
 o Changed the priority of the filter_final_output method so it will hopefully
   be the very last to be executed
 o Started a plugin.xml
 o The HTTP header Vary is now being sent to the client, making life easier for
   proxies.
 o Compression handling by the plugin is now deactivated if PHP's own
   zlib.output_compression configuration directive is set
 o Output compression is now prevented if http headers have already been sent
   out to the client

1.0-beta
 o Started the entire thing
